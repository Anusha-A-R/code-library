            Anusha with dogs and their bones

Anusha loves dogs so she always goes to dog's park and gives 
each dog a paricular number of bones. All the dogs eagerly wait 
for her to come and as she comes they line up to get bones.
For the first dog she always gives 1 bone. 
Then she gives bones to dogs by following next 2 operations
-Then for the next dog she gives the next smallest number of bones 
which is not yet given to any dog.
-Then for next n-1 number of dogs where n is total number 
of dogs for whome bones are given she gives same number of bones 
as given for first n-1 dogs.

Since Anusha is busy distributing bones to dogs. Could you help her know 
how much bones did 'm'th dog got.
And also tell the luckiest dog who got most number of bones.

Input format:
Input containing 2 space seperated integers first n then m

Constraints:
1<=n<=2*10^5
1<=m<=n

Output format:
First print number of bones given to 'm'th dog and in next line print the number
 of luckiest dog.

 Sample Test Cases:
 Input: 10 7
 Output:1 8

 Explaination: So there are 10 dogs then distribution of bones goes like
               1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2
               So 7th dog got 1 bone and 8th dog was luckiest as it got 4 bones.
